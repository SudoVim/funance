# Tickers vs Funds

The purpose of this project for me is to create "funds" to track the investment
activity of people so that others can mimic it. In addition, I'd like to be
able to provide insights so that people can make smarter investment decisions.

## Tickers

Tickers are just the ticker itself. It'll be used to download different
resolutions of historic OHLC data. Maybe at some point, it'll deal with raw
transactions, but I bet that data is expensive.

## Funds

Funds are a collection of purchases - ticker, price, time pairs that can be
used to resurrect the health of the fund. You'll also be able to see its growth
over time.

## Fund Purchases

Each fund purchase will be associated with a fund itself
